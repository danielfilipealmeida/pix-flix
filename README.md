# PixFlix: Frame by Frame Mac-nic!

Welcome to PixFlix, the fun and easy way to turn your images into a video on your Mac! Whether you're creating a photo montage or a quick slideshow, PixFlix has got you covered.

## Project Overview

PixFlix is an OS X application that allows you to compose videos from a series of images. With PixFlix, you can:

- **Create a Video**: Combine multiple images to create a video.
- **Rearrange Images**: Easily reorder your images to get them in the perfect sequence.
- **Resize Images**: All images will be automatically resized to match the final video size.
- **Set Final Duration**: Define the total duration of your video, with each image's display time calculated accordingly.

### Important Notes:
- Aspect ratios of images are **not** respected; if an image's ratio differs from the final video's ratio, it will be distorted.
- The final duration of the video determines how long each image will be shown based on the number of images.
